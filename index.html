          <p>Univers type is widely around considered as Adrian Frutiger's main masterpiece.
            Its all 27 styles go on from Ultra Condensed Thin type to Extra Extended Black,
            but still gives great impression of steadiness and homogeneity when combined.</p>

          <p>..From my experience of designing typefaces the most important thing I have learned is
            that the legalibilty and beauty stands on close together and that design, in its restraint,
            should be only felt but not perceived by the reader. Adrian Frutiger</p>

          <p>Mr.Adrian Frutiger was born in May 24, 1928 in Bern Switzerland and is highly talented
            typeface designer who has widely influenced the direction of digital typography in the
            second half of the 20th century and into the 21st. He is the best known for creating Univers and
            Frutiger typefaces.</p>
          <p>Univers is the name of a realistic typeface, san Serif typeface designed by Adrain Frutiger
            in 1954. This is one of a group of neo-grotesque san-serif typefaces, all released in 1957,
            that includes Folo and Neu Haas Grotesk later call Halvetical. These three faces are somrtimes
            confused with each other, because each is based on the 1895 type-face Akzideriz-Grotesk. These
            typefaces are prominent in the Swiss Style of graphic design.</p>
          <p>In 1997 Frutiger did a rework on the whole Universe Family of type in cooperation with
            Linotype Univers which consists of 63 fonts.</p>
